## How does the mantle upwell at mid-ocean ridges?
## What is the impact of mid-ocean ridge dynamics and upwelling on the large-scale structure of the oceanic upper mantle?

Fundamental questions remain unanswered about the evolution and structure of oceanic plates, and observational evidence gathered at mid-ocean ridges, the sites where these plates are generated, will enable us to answer these questions. To gather such observational evidence, this ambitious experiment will deploy 40 ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs) across ridge-ridge triple junctions, which have never been seismically imaged at upper-mantle depths. 

The resulting broadband seismic data will be profoundly impactful to the fields of marine geophysics and tectonics. We will process this data and generate images of the oceanic upper mantle at these locations using a wide array of passive seismic imaging approaches, including body- and surface-wave imaging. The resulting seismic observations will provide in-situ constraints on mantle discontinuity structure, composition and temperature, and fabric orientations, providing results that enable us to test a wide suite of geodynamic models for mid-ocean ridge evolution and structure. 

This project has been funded by the U.S. **National Science Foundation**'s *Division of Ocean Sciences* under award number *2143865*.
