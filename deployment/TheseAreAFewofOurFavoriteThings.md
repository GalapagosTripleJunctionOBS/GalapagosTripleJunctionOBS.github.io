# These Are a Few of *Our* Favorite Things

When I first considered the idea of being on a boat for a month, it seemed to be a very
daunting experience. My longest trip on water had been approximately three hours maximum, on
a ferry between islands. I was incredibly unsure what to expect about being on a boat of this size,
spending a month on the water with no land in sight, or spending so much time (and in very close
quarters) with people I hadn’t met before. Needless to say, I have been enjoying myself
immensely and have loved getting to know the rest of the science party and ship crew. My
favorite thing has definitely turned out to be the connections I have formed and the peacefulness
being away from on-land responsibilities has brought. I tend to be a very shy person, and in the
spirit of trying new things, I really wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone for this blog
and try to start a conversation with everybody aboard the Langseth. So what better way to do this
then ask them what their favorite thing is about being on a boat? The following is a list of
(almost) everyone I’ve spoken to and what they enjoy most about being on a ship.

I have split the list into three sections to explore how length of time at sea alters what
becomes a favorite thing on the boat. The sections are as follows: those who are on a long boat
trip for the first time, those who have been on another research cruise in the past, and those who
have spent a lot of time on deck in the open seas. (Note: all names and positions have been
selected by each individual and may or may not be accurate representations of what they do on
the boat)
