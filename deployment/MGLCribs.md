# MGL Cribs

**Dearest Readers,**

Welcome to MGL Cribs! I’m your host, Giselle, and this post is your all-access tour of our humble abode abroad this research vessel for the month. Prepare to shuffle, slide, and sometimes trip through the tight, row-motion-filled halls as we move from one quarter to another. Don’t worry, you’ll be getting a full peek at everything from our cozy quarters to the functional (and occasionally goofy) spaces where we work. 
First things first, let me reassure you that the engine room is off-limits for this post. Will’s blog post from earlier goes into detail about the mysterious space (if you’re brave enough to read about it), and frankly, I’ll leave the engine talk to the experts. However, don’t fret–our good friend Bubbles has promised a special scoop after making a deal with Vinni, our first assistant engineer. Stay tuned for that!
