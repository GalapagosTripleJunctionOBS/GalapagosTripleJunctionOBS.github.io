# MGL Cribs

**Dearest Readers,**

Welcome to MGL Cribs! I’m your host, Giselle, and this post is your all-access tour of our humble abode abroad this research vessel for the month. Prepare to shuffle, slide, and sometimes trip through the tight, row-motion-filled halls as we move from one quarter to another. Don’t worry, you’ll be getting a full peek at everything from our cozy quarters to the functional (and occasionally goofy) spaces where we work. 
First things first, let me reassure you that the engine room is off-limits for this post. Will’s blog post from earlier goes into detail about the mysterious space (if you’re brave enough to read about it), and frankly, I’ll leave the engine talk to the experts. However, don’t fret–our good friend Bubbles has promised a special scoop after making a deal with Vinni, our first assistant engineer. Stay tuned for that!

**Let’s start with the junior scientist living space, shall we?**

As we shuffle down the hall, we’ll first pass by the laundry room. Now, we could try to sneak a quick peek and see if there’s anyone, we know who’s currently doing laundry. 

$${\color{lightblue}“Ahh, \space  Kavi, \space  anything \space  to \space  say \space  for \space  the \space  blog?” \space }$$	

$${\color{red}“No?” \space }$$	

$${\color{lightblue}“Cool \space cool. \space  We’ll \space  let \space  you \space  get \space   back \space  to \space  your \space  laundry \space  then."}$$	

Alright, moving on! As we step into the Day Room 203 (holds rooms 201-204), take note of how they’ve cleverly placed all the women far from the rest of the crew and right next to the laundry room. We are a giggly bunch, so it honestly makes sense.  
Quick tour note: The first door in 203 (201, from left to right) belongs to Helin and Jess. Let’s see what they’re up to today! Oh, it’s a classic: a wild Jess, found reading in bed—nothing unusual here. People here take the book club seriously, and it so happens to be Jess’ current obsession. It’s serious business. 

Oh, look–the bathroom is open. In case you’re wondering, all the bathrooms in 200 are “Jack and Jill,” meaning they connect rooms. If you follow me through Jess’ space, we’ll pop over to the bathroom that connects to Kenni and I’s room. *Hmmm…wait, what’s this?* Did we catch Helin hiding in the bathroom? Wild. Let’s leave her be for now…

Are you getting a good sense of how tight our living spaces are yet? Don’t worry, it’s not all bad! Quarters 200 also has a nice shared common space. We have two windows that offer great views of the abyss, and at times some pretty gnarly waves. 
Looks like the others aren’t around, but hey, let’s sneak a peek into the men’s junior scientist living quarters. 

*Lights are on…but no one’s home?* Oh wait–there’s Cris. Is he sleeping? It must be tough being an influencer on the night shift.

**Next up–The Mess (a.k.a the cafeteria)**

Now as we step into the finely finished vinyl floors of the Mess, I ask that you hold the utmost respect. 

This is sacred ground. 

This is where Chantal, John, and Marcello, who so graciously welcome us to their commons from: 

* 07:20-08:20 {Breakfast}
* 11:30-12:30 {Lunch}
* 17:00-18:00 {Dinner}

Every day. With sustenance. That fuels the soul. 

Before the jealousy sets in, let me clarify–it’s valid. We eat well and do no cleanup afterwards. 

$${\color{black}  *Click!* \space }$$	

$${\color{lightblue}“What \space are \space y’all \space doing \space to \space poor \space Bubbles?” }$$	

$${\color{black} “We \space caught \space him \space making \space his \space way \space down \space to \space Vinni \space and \space he \space asked \space us \space to \space help \space him \space think \space of \space poses.”   }$$	

$${\color{lightblue}“Why \space would \space he \space need \space poses?” }$$	

$${\color{black} “We \space  don’t  \space know. \space  He  \space said \space  it \space  had  \space to \space  do  \space with  \space what  \space he  \space has  \space planned  \space for  \space his \space  meeting  \space with  \space Vinni…”  }$$	

$${\color{lightblue} “Hmm.  \space I  \space sure \space  hope  \space he’s  \space getting \space  us  \space that  \space special \space  scoop  \space and \space  not  \space just  \space goofing \space  off.”  }$$	

Anyway, back to the food. 
To the left of the serving station is a snack corner stocked with instant ramen, fresh pastries, cereal, and emergency saltines (shoutout to those fighting sea-sickness). With some folks working night shifts, meals can be missed, so these are crucial backups. Or just, you know, snacks. 
On the adjacent wall (not pictured) is: 

* A salad bar that also features salad-adjacent items and holds meals for those who reserve them outside of Mess hours. 
* A drink area that holds everything needed to make a mean cup of coffee, tea, or chocolate syrup delight. 
* A fridge, home to a myriad of milks, juices, yogurts, and more. 

Important cultural fact: chocolate milk after dinner is revered by many onboard. Don’t get it confused with hot chocolate. There’s absolutely a difference. 

As we head out of the Mess, you’ll spot the freezer, filled with ice cream, that keeps you cool near the equator. The lineup changes often, but lately it includes ice cream sandwiches, Blue Bunny, and other frozen treasures.

**The Main Lab: Where ½  the Magic Happens **

As you step in, you’ll be greeted by a wall of glowing monitors. They show everything from navigation data to sonar maps. 

Usually, Gilles, one of our science technicians, is right in the middle of it all, making sure everything’s running smoothly.

To the left is the Chimera station, where folks like Jess (currently there!) clean up bathymetry data from our voyage. To the right is “the office,” where we gather for crossword nights and keep score of who’s done more deployments. Also, occasionally used for actual meetings, but I don’t want to bore you.

The monitors display sonar feeds, navigational info, and camera footage from around the ship. But seismometers? You won’t find those deployed from here. 

For that, let’s suit up in PPE and head to the Main Deck.

**Main deck (the other ½): **

Hard hats + tropical humidity = not the best combo. But safety first, and the vest and hats make a great shield from bird excrement (speaking from experience, unfortunately). 

On the starboard side, towards the stern (boat lingo, if you’re unfamiliar) is where we tow the MAGGIETM (our 882 magnetometer) that’s used to measure subtle changes in Earth's magnetic field. One deck above is where we deploy the XBTs (T-7 Expendable Bathythermograph probes), which measure sound velocity for multibeam processing.

Back on the main deck, we’ve got a nearly ready OBS. Everything is set up except for the seismometer, which is added just before deployment. Above it is the A-frame crane, used to deploy the OBS. Many of us have scored solid LinkedIn-worthy photos from influencer Cody.

To the left of the main deck is the wet lab, home to most OBS setup tools and the entry point to the Dry Lab.

**Dry Lab (Top Left photos) **

This is survey central. Here, you’ll find Alan to the left, checking that the ping storage scripts are running smoothly. Dan is to the right of him, analyzing the Pac-Man survey map while contemplating the mysteries of time. PWR and sensitivity settings for OBS ranging seem to follow no logic, but thankfully the OBS techs keep us grounded. Dan, Alan, Hannah, and Tim: you’re the real MVPs. 

We recently discovered some of the sonar circuit boards are stored here too! After a board imploded, science technicians Nick and Cody showed the night shifters how not all heroes wear capes.
