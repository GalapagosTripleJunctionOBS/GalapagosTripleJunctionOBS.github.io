# MGL Cribs

**Dearest Readers,**

Welcome to MGL Cribs! I’m your host, Giselle, and this post is your all-access tour of our humble abode abroad this research vessel for the month. Prepare to shuffle, slide, and sometimes trip through the tight, row-motion-filled halls as we move from one quarter to another. Don’t worry, you’ll be getting a full peek at everything from our cozy quarters to the functional (and occasionally goofy) spaces where we work. 
First things first, let me reassure you that the engine room is off-limits for this post. Will’s blog post from earlier goes into detail about the mysterious space (if you’re brave enough to read about it), and frankly, I’ll leave the engine talk to the experts. However, don’t fret–our good friend Bubbles has promised a special scoop after making a deal with Vinni, our first assistant engineer. Stay tuned for that!

**Let’s start with the junior scientist living space, shall we?**

As we shuffle down the hall, we’ll first pass by the laundry room. Now, we could try to sneak a quick peek and see if there’s anyone, we know who’s currently doing laundry. 

$${\color{lightblue}“Ahh, \space  Kavi, \space  anything \space  to \space  say \space  for \space  the \space  blog?” \space }$$	

$${\color{red}“No?” \space }$$	

$${\color{lightblue}“Cool \space cool. \space  We’ll \space  let \space  you \space  get \space   back \space  to \space  your \space  laundry \space  then."}$$	

Alright, moving on! As we step into the Day Room 203 (holds rooms 201-204), take note of how they’ve cleverly placed all the women far from the rest of the crew and right next to the laundry room. We are a giggly bunch, so it honestly makes sense.  
Quick tour note: The first door in 203 (201, from left to right) belongs to Helin and Jess. Let’s see what they’re up to today! Oh, it’s a classic: a wild Jess, found reading in bed—nothing unusual here. People here take the book club seriously, and it so happens to be Jess’ current obsession. It’s serious business. 

Oh, look–the bathroom is open. In case you’re wondering, all the bathrooms in 200 are “Jack and Jill,” meaning they connect rooms. If you follow me through Jess’ space, we’ll pop over to the bathroom that connects to Kenni and I’s room. *Hmmm…wait, what’s this?* Did we catch Helin hiding in the bathroom? Wild. Let’s leave her be for now…

Are you getting a good sense of how tight our living spaces are yet? Don’t worry, it’s not all bad! Quarters 200 also has a nice shared common space. We have two windows that offer great views of the abyss, and at times some pretty gnarly waves. 
Looks like the others aren’t around, but hey, let’s sneak a peek into the men’s junior scientist living quarters. 

*Lights are on…but no one’s home?* Oh wait–there’s Cris. Is he sleeping? It must be tough being an influencer on the night shift.
