# MGL *Cribs*

**Dearest Readers,**

Welcome to MGL Cribs! I’m your host, Giselle, and this post is your all-access tour of our humble abode aboard this research vessel for the month. Prepare to shuffle, slide, and sometimes trip through the tight, row-motion-filled halls as we move from one quarter to another. Don’t worry, you’ll be getting a full peek at everything from our cozy quarters to the functional (and occasionally goofy) spaces where we work. 
First things first, let me reassure you that the engine room is off-limits for this post. Will’s blog post from earlier goes into detail about the mysterious space (if you’re brave enough to read about it), and frankly, I’ll leave the engine talk to the experts. However, don’t fret–our good friend Bubbles has promised a special scoop after making a deal with Vinni, our first assistant engineer. Stay tuned for that!

**Let’s start with the junior scientist living space, shall we?**

As we shuffle down the hall, we’ll first pass by the laundry room. Now, we could try to sneak a quick peek and see if there’s anyone, we know who’s currently doing laundry. 

<font color="#89CFF0">“Ahh, Kavi, anything to say for the blog?”</font> <br>

<font color="#FF2626">"No?"</font> <br>

<font color="#89CFF0">“Cool cool. We’ll let you get back to your laundry then”. </font> <br>

Alright, moving on! As we step into the Day Room 203 (holds rooms 201-204), take note of how they’ve cleverly placed all the women far from the rest of the crew and right next to the laundry room. We are a giggly bunch, so it honestly makes sense.  
Quick tour note: The first door in 203 (201, from left to right) belongs to Helin and Jess. Let’s see what they’re up to today! Oh, it’s a classic: a wild Jess, found reading in bed—nothing unusual here. People here take the book club seriously, and it so happens to be Jess’ current obsession. It’s serious business. 

Oh, look–the bathroom is open. In case you’re wondering, all the bathrooms in 200 are “Jack and Jill,” meaning they connect rooms. If you follow me through Jess’ space, we’ll pop over to the bathroom that connects to Kenni and I’s room. *Hmmm…wait, what’s this?* Did we catch Helin hiding in the bathroom? Wild. Let’s leave her be for now…

Are you getting a good sense of how tight our living spaces are yet? Don’t worry, it’s not all bad! Quarters 200 also has a nice shared common space. We have two windows that offer great views of the abyss, and at times some pretty gnarly waves. 
Looks like the others aren’t around, but hey, let’s sneak a peek into the men’s junior scientist living quarters. 

*Lights are on…but no one’s home?* Oh wait–there’s Cris. Is he sleeping? It must be tough being an influencer on the night shift.

**Next up–The Mess (a.k.a the cafeteria)**

Now as we step into the finely finished vinyl floors of the Mess, I ask that you hold the utmost respect. 

This is sacred ground. 

This is where Chantal, John, and Marcello, who so graciously welcome us to their commons from: 

* 07:20-08:20 {Breakfast}
* 11:30-12:30 {Lunch}
* 17:00-18:00 {Dinner}

Every day. With sustenance. That fuels the soul. 

Before the jealousy sets in, let me clarify–it’s valid. We eat well and do no cleanup afterwards. 

<font color="#00001A">*Click!*</font> <br>

<font color="#89CFF0">“What are y’all doing to poor Bubbles?”</font> <br>

<font color="#00001A">“We caught him making his way down to Vinni and he asked us to help him think of poses.” </font> <br>

<font color="#89CFF0">“Why would he need poses?” </font> <br>

<font color="#00001A">“We don’t know. He said it had to do with what he has planned for his meeting with Vinni…” </font> <br>

<font color="#89CFF0">“Hmm. I sure hope he’s getting us that special scoop and not just goofing off.”  </font> <br>


Anyway, back to the food. 
To the left of the serving station is a snack corner stocked with instant ramen, fresh pastries, cereal, and emergency saltines (shoutout to those fighting sea-sickness). With some folks working night shifts, meals can be missed, so these are crucial backups. Or just, you know, snacks. 
On the adjacent wall (not pictured) is: 

* A salad bar that also features salad-adjacent items and holds meals for those who reserve them outside of Mess hours. 
* A drink area that holds everything needed to make a mean cup of coffee, tea, or chocolate syrup delight. 
* A fridge, home to a myriad of milks, juices, yogurts, and more. 

Important cultural fact: chocolate milk after dinner is revered by many onboard. Don’t get it confused with hot chocolate. There’s absolutely a difference. 

As we head out of the Mess, you’ll spot the freezer, filled with ice cream, that keeps you cool near the equator. The lineup changes often, but lately it includes ice cream sandwiches, Blue Bunny, and other frozen treasures.

**The Main Lab: Where ½  the Magic Happens**

As you step in, you’ll be greeted by a wall of glowing monitors. They show everything from navigation data to sonar maps. 

Usually, Gilles, one of our science technicians, is right in the middle of it all, making sure everything’s running smoothly.

To the left is the Chimera station, where folks like Jess (currently there!) clean up bathymetry data from our voyage. To the right is “the office,” where we gather for crossword nights and keep score of who’s done more deployments. Also, occasionally used for actual meetings, but I don’t want to bore you.

The monitors display sonar feeds, navigational info, and camera footage from around the ship. But seismometers? You won’t find those deployed from here. 

For that, let’s suit up in PPE and head to the Main Deck.

**Main deck (the other ½):**

Hard hats + tropical humidity = not the best combo. But safety first, and the vest and hats make a great shield from bird excrement (speaking from experience, unfortunately). 

On the starboard side, towards the stern (boat lingo, if you’re unfamiliar) is where we tow the MAGGIETM (our 882 magnetometer) that’s used to measure subtle changes in Earth's magnetic field. One deck above is where we deploy the XBTs (T-7 Expendable Bathythermograph probes), which measure sound velocity for multibeam processing.

Back on the main deck, we’ve got a nearly ready OBS. Everything is set up except for the seismometer, which is added just before deployment. Above it is the A-frame crane, used to deploy the OBS. Many of us have scored solid LinkedIn-worthy photos from influencer Cody.

To the left of the main deck is the wet lab, home to most OBS setup tools and the entry point to the Dry Lab.

**Dry Lab (Top Left photos)**

This is survey central. Here, you’ll find Alan to the left, checking that the ping storage scripts are running smoothly. Dan is to the right of him, analyzing the Pac-Man survey map while contemplating the mysteries of time. PWR and sensitivity settings for OBS ranging seem to follow no logic, but thankfully the OBS techs keep us grounded. Dan, Alan, Hannah, and Tim: you’re the real MVPs. 

We recently discovered some of the sonar circuit boards are stored here too! After a board imploded, science technicians Nick and Cody showed the night shifters how not all heroes wear capes.

**The Rest (Yes, there’s more)**

With time to spare, let’s take a lap. Starting at the back (front’s been claimed by the birds and let’s not talk about the smell). 

Ah, the gym. It’s crucial to triple check the time before entering, especially around 3:30 PM, when the captain is usually in there. You do not want to disturb a man with a lot on his plate–is that Cate?

*Oh hey, Cate! You got this!* Let’s leave so she can finish her workouts in peace.  

Down past the Mess is the library, where we find another wild reader, Kenni, who’s also reading Circe. The library offers a full range of genres. And yes, they’ve correctly categorized Twilight. The first three as classical literature and the last as nonfiction. If you are ever in need of a rec, I’d go to Mike, our electrician and resident former English major.

Just outside the library is the theater room. We’ve only used it a few times, we’ve watched Twisters (2024) and played Mario Kart once. The second and third mates have quarters nearby and we wouldn’t want to disrupt their rest. Still, we’ve been crushing movies in the Main Lab office anyway.

  **Bubbles’ Secret Scoop (As told by Bubbles, the intrepid chicken adventurer)**

Hi y’all! It’s me, Bubbles! Opus MCguinnes, chief cruise director, has let me tag along as his seafaring companion for over 20 years, and I figured it’s high time I take over the engine room. I’ve traveled to every continent except Antarctica, floated in more water samples than I can count, and served as moral support during many a deployment. So yes, I absolutely think I’m qualified. Vinni doesn’t quite agree. He thinks I’m just here for the photo op with the largest wrench (which, to be fair, I was). But while he was distracted, I managed to snag a few iconic shots: 


* Heroically perched near the sewage door (smells like victory)
* Traveling through time in a make-shift engine room time machine 
* Winning "Employee of the Month" (self-awarded, obviously) 
* And, of course, wielding the mighty wrench like I was born to turn bolts

It was going swimmingly until Vinni walked in and caught me mid-command of the throttle. After a very stern quack-ing to, he called Josh over the radio. Moments later, I was gently but firmly removed by Crystal and Anant from my post and sentenced to time-out. 

**Current status:** in jail (a.k.a. under a glass dome in the Dry Lab, made from half an OBS casing). I’m not mad–every good captain has to be humbled now and then. Besides, I’ve got a great view of the live cast and plenty of company during night shift.

</figure>

**The MUSTARD Deck**

Well, that was almost a catastrophe. Let's close out this whirlwind tour on a calm note.

Here we are at the MUSTER Deck, our designated emergency muster station and a peaceful little corner of the ship that offers panoramic views of the open ocean. Just a few steps beyond this is the bridge, where the captain and officers keep us on course–we don’t go there unless invited, and only then in our best behavior.

The MUSTER deck, though, is a favorite hangout. This spot has a special kind of magic. Whether it’s gathering for a safety drill, trying to catch a glimpse of a green flash at sunset, or leaning over the rail during night shift just to feel the breeze and hear the waves. Some nights, we come here just to stargaze. It’s one of the few places you can still see the Milky Way in all its glory, unobstructed by city lights.

**Until Next Time...**

And that, dearest readers, concludes your official tour of MGL Cribs!

From laundry room interviews to engine room infiltrations (looking at you, Bubbles), we hope this gave you a glimpse of the real heart of life aboard a research vessel: the people, the quirks, the odd comfort of routine, and the adventure that hums behind every hallway.

Thanks for joining me on this tour. I hear there’s much more fun to come. Until then, keep it salty.

Sea you soon,

Giselle

p.s (from Bubbles)

I’ve escaped from dome’s constraints! And in my freedom, I wanted to send thanks to Vinni for allowing me into the engine room.
