# Life Aboard

<p style="text-align:center">
  Grand is the ocean before me
So vast is the sea, intimidatingly—
I once feared the thought of mere me
Floating through the ocean, endlessly…

Now I see beauty in the deepest blues,
And the wildlife as my heart’s muse.
Seabirds sail across the sky;
Among them, my soul can fly.
</p>

I had the honor of helping a bird (Tahiti petrel). As Kenni and I walked to the stern to watch the
sunset, she spotted a trapped bird flailing between a beam and a large spool that holds
streamers. I reached down and lifted the bird out. After resting with us a while, Dan (WHOI
Senior Engineering Assistant) carried the bird up to the streamer deck for a successful release.
I’m happy to report with Dan’s send-off, the bird flew off to rejoin their flock hanging out
nearby. Tahiti petrels are classified as near threatened. To those who wonder if I named this
Tahiti petrel, I did not. It is my point of view that I have no right to name a wild and free animal.
It was only our duty to help as our presence inadvertently put this bird in danger.

Being a prior service veteran, I am accustomed to working with groups of people who I didn’t
know beforehand. I wasn’t sure what to expect from the science party or the crew as a whole.
The majority of the grad students in the science party are geophysicists who are associated with
the Primary Investigator’s lab group located at UC Santa Barbara. I am a PhD candidate from
Louisiana State University and am here because there were a couple of junior scientist positions
open, and I applied. It has been a long-time aspiration to sail aboard a research vessel and be a
part of a science party. However, I am an igneous petrologist and hard-rock geochemist, and
this mission does not include rock sampling. Even so, I found that being a geologist from an
adjacent field has proved beneficial for collaboration. As my master’s advisor said, “the best
geoscientists are [those] who can do and understand both [Geology and Geophysics].” I’ve
been able to provide insights on mid-ocean ridge morphologies, crustal accretion processes,
and oceanic rock types (ranging from crustal to mantle) while also learning about different
types of geophysical methods, data collection, and how geophysical studies can complement
geological perspectives. I am very grateful to be a part of the science party, and I’ve been
fortunate to be among people who have provided a sense of community. I hope this can open
the door between us for collaborative studies and maybe even future joint missions.

Of the new skills I’ve acquired, assembling Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) packages is my
favorite. I enjoy working with my hands and using tools, so this is right up my alley. Recently, an
issue during a deployment required us to quickly reassemble a new OBS package. Because we
were relatively close to the drop location, that experience demonstrated to myself how much I
had learned since I was able to think fast and swiftly assist the technicians.

When I’m not helping with the OBSs, I’m usually processing multibeam data which mostly
consists of removing scatter. While a somewhat tedious task, the bigger picture is contributing
to the mapping of previously unmapped seafloor, and in a significantly better resolution than
satellite data can provide.

I’m on the 14:00-22:00 shift, and most of our deployments have been at night. We’ve had the
fortune of seeing jellyfish, flying fish, and eels that are attracted to the lights on deck where we
assemble and deploy the OBSs. Looking beyond that area, vast darkness consumes as far as the
eye can see. It brings a humbling sense of the reality of where we are.

<p style="text-align:center">
The sky meets the sea, endlessly
Darkness is all I see in front of me…
</p>

I don’t want to end on a dark note. There are multiple perspectives and endless aspects to
appreciate. I’ve seen some of the most beautiful sunsets, have heard some of the most
interesting stories from technicians, and shared in light-hearted conversations with the crew. I
may not be the most talkative person, but I appreciate good company. The inclusion and
acceptance among people from diverse backgrounds provides enrichment that is unattainable
otherwise. Everyone contributes to the success of the mission. Every person is significant. By
working together, we do more than cooperate; we empower one another.

Closing with a poem: 

<p style="text-align:center">
“Timelines”

Lives intersect along peculiar paths.
Though, consistency is yet to last—
Share a point, a place in time;
briefly, converging along a line…

</p>
