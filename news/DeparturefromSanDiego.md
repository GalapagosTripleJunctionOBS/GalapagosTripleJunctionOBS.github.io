# The Galapagos Triple Junction OBS Deployment has begun!

 **Sunday September 7th; 9:53 PM**.

Our vessel, the R.V. Marcus Langseth, formally departed San Diego (after refueling) on Sunday night, September 7th, 2025. You can follow our path using [Marine Traffic's helpful utility here.]([http://example.com](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:435849/mmsi:367059880/imo:9010137/vessel:MARCUS_G_LANGSETH))
Our science party of 12, comprising a variety of scientists at different career stages, is incredibly excited and fortunate to be able to head on this journey and share it with you!
