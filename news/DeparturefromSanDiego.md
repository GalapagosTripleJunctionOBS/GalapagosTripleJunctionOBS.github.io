# The Galapagos Triple Junction OBS Deployment has begun!

 **Sunday September 7th; 9:53 PM**.

Our vessel, the R.V. Marcus Langseth, formally departed San Diego (after refueling) on Sunday night, September 7th, 2025. You can follow our path using [Marine Traffic's helpful utility here.](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:435849/mmsi:367059880/imo:9010137/vessel:MARCUS_G_LANGSETH)
Our [science party](https://galapagostriplejunctionobs.github.io/experiment/team/), comprising a variety of scientists at different career stages, is incredibly excited and fortunate to be able to head on this journey and share it with you! Please explore the rest of this website to learn more about our [project, goals](https://galapagostriplejunctionobs.github.io/About/Rationale), and follow along our day-to-day experiences on our blog as we (and the incredible Langseth crew) embark on this unique adventure together!
